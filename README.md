# eHouse-Studio Starter Theme Project

Showcase for my dream company eHouse Studion in Charleston, SC. 

## PLEASE READ
So, I started with the Slate theme to showoff some cool stuff however it wasn't loading in the node-sass and I noticed it is no longer supported as of Jan. 2020 so I am ditching it. Please take a look at the custom Password section where I created a snippet and section for a custom Login page. 

In addition, I decided to just work off the Debut theme as I would normally use that or another premium theme. Here is the custom page I made for eHouse [eHouse Custom Page in Shopify](https://ehouse-test-shop.myshopify.com/pages/about-gabe)

Thanks!
